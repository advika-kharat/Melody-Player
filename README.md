# Melody-Player
The Melody-Player is a simple and interactive music player made using the ESP32 micro-controller.
The project utilizes ESP32 to generate musical tones and control the playback of the melodies. By connecting a piezo buzzer to the micro-controller, the melodies are played by sending specific frequencies to the buzzer. 
The user can touch specific wires and melodies are played corresponding to it. Additionally, the LCD displays the melody being played.
